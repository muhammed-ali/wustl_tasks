# Scientist Tasks  

This repository contains the necessary scripts (and most of the input files) for completing four bioinformatics-related tasks.  

Every sub-directory contains the files relevant to a particular task, which include:  

+ a README file  

+ script(s)  

+ input files (if they are not large enough e.g. Task 13)  

+ results and/or intermediate file(s)
